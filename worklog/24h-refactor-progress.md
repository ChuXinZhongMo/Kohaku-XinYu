# XinYu 24h Refactor Progress

Date: 2026-05-07
Workspace: D:\XinYu

## Loop 1 - 18:30

- Task: Create the 24h baseline queue, progress log, and refactor checklist.
- Why: The run plan requires each later slice to be selected, verified, recorded, and committed independently from a visible queue.
- Files changed:
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `git status --short --branch`
  - `git log --oneline -3`
  - `rg --files`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter '*smoke*.py'`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter 'xinyu_bridge*.py'`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter 'xinyu_qq*.py'`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter 'xinyu_desktop*.py'`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `git status --short --branch`
- Result: Baseline files created and `git diff --check` passed. `XINYU-24H-WORK-PLAN.md` remains untracked as user-provided run input.
- Risk: Documentation-only; no runtime, memory, persona, QQ outbound, or v1 traffic behavior touched.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-1-commit>`
- Next: Build `XINYU-VALIDATION-MATRIX.md` from the existing smoke and pytest inventory.

## Loop 2 - 18:28

- Task: Add the validation matrix for refactor gates.
- Why: The bridge and gateway are too concentrated to refactor safely without an explicit capability-to-command map.
- Files changed:
  - `XINYU-VALIDATION-MATRIX.md`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `Get-Content VALIDATION-INDEX.md`
  - `Get-Content RUNTIME-VALIDATION-NOTES.md`
  - `Get-Content smoke_run.py -TotalCount 200`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter '*qq*smoke*.py'`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter '*v1*smoke*.py'`
  - `Get-ChildItem -File -Filter '*state*smoke*.py'`
  - `Test-Path tests\test_learning_closed_loop.py`
  - `Test-Path tests\v1\test_bridge_compatibility.py`
  - `Test-Path tests\v1\test_hybrid_router.py`
  - `Test-Path tests\test_v1_canary_readiness.py`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Validation matrix drafted with capability gates, slice gates, and weak/missing gates. `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Documentation-only; no route, payload, persona, memory body, QQ outbound, or v1 traffic behavior touched.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-2-commit>`
- Next: Choose the first code slice with the new validation gate in place.

## Loop 3 - 18:35

- Task: Extract the Desktop event service startup/shutdown boundary from `xinyu_core_bridge.py`.
- Why: Desktop events are a distinct bridge-side service; moving their assembly and lifecycle out of `main()` reduces core bridge ownership without changing routes or payloads.
- Files changed:
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_desktop_service.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_core_bridge.py`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
- Commands:
  - `rg -n "DesktopEventBus|DesktopWSServer" xinyu_core_bridge.py`
  - `rg -n "desktop_ws_server|desktop_event_bus" xinyu_core_bridge.py`
  - `Get-Content xinyu_core_bridge.py` focused on main and desktop methods
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile xinyu_core_bridge.py xinyu_desktop_service.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_desktop_rest_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_desktop_ws_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_desktop_events_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe bridge_probe_smoke.py`
- Result: Desktop event service assembly moved into `xinyu_desktop_service.py`. Compile, Desktop REST, Desktop WS, Desktop events, and bridge probe smokes passed.
- Risk: Low; route names, request/response payloads, ports, auth guard calls, and event bus semantics are preserved.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-3-commit>`
- Next: If validation passes, continue with a second bridge or state-write slice.

## Loop 4 - 18:50

- Task: Add the state write audit.
- Why: State writes are spread across Markdown, JSON, JSONL, SQLite, runtime traces, projections, and memory files; the next helper/refactor slice needs a governed target list.
- Files changed:
  - `XINYU-STATE-WRITE-AUDIT.md`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `rg -n "write_text|open|jsonl|sqlite" -g "*.py"`
  - `rg -n "_atomic_write|write_text_atomic|append_jsonl|jsonl|sqlite|connect" -g "*.py"`
  - `rg -n "memory/|runtime/|logs/|cache/|context/" xinyu_core_bridge.py xinyu_qq_gateway.py xinyu_qq_outbox.py xinyu_runtime_presence.py xinyu_state_io.py`
  - `Get-Content xinyu_state_io.py`
  - `Get-Content state_io_smoke.py`
  - `Get-Content xinyu_core_bridge.py` focused on direct write sites
  - `Get-Content xinyu_qq_gateway.py` focused on trust config persistence
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: State write audit drafted with directory semantics, helper inventory, direct-write risks, and first migration candidates. `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Documentation-only; no memory body, runtime state, QQ outbound, or v1 behavior touched.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-4-commit>`
- Next: Introduce a small state helper seed or move to QQ trust policy extraction.

## Loop 5 - 19:05

- Task: Add a small `state_service.py` helper seed.
- Why: The audit showed repeated atomic text/JSON and JSONL append patterns; a focused helper gives future migrations a governed target without changing existing production writes yet.
- Files changed:
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/state_service.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/state_io_smoke.py`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `git status --short --branch`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile state_service.py state_io_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe state_io_smoke.py`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Helper seed added with atomic text, atomic JSON, JSON read, and JSONL append helpers. Compile, `state_io_smoke.py`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Low; helper is not wired into production callers, so no memory body, runtime state, QQ outbound, or v1 behavior changes.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-5-commit>`
- Next: If validation passes, migrate one low-risk projection writer or move to QQ trust policy extraction.

## Loop 6 - 19:25

- Task: Extract QQ trust policy helpers from `xinyu_qq_gateway.py`.
- Why: Trust, whitelist, block, and group-shadow decisions are policy logic; keeping the gateway methods as wrappers preserves tests while moving pure decisions out of the transport class.
- Files changed:
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_qq_trust_policy.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_qq_gateway.py`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `rg -n "whitelist|trusted|blocked|group_trigger|trust" xinyu_qq_gateway.py`
  - `rg -n "TRUST_GRANT_TEXT_MARKERS|TRUST_REVOKE_TEXT_MARKERS|_looks_like_trust|_is_trusted|_trust_level|_effective_whitelist"`
  - `Get-Content xinyu_qq_gateway.py` focused on trust methods
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile xinyu_qq_gateway.py xinyu_qq_trust_policy.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_qq_gateway_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_qq_review_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe qq_outbox_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe check_sent_index.py` failed once because the CLI requires `adapter_msg_id`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_gateway_ack_spool.py::test_sent_reply_index_lookup_by_adapter_message_id -q`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe check_sent_index.py --help`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Trust policy helpers extracted and wrapper behavior preserved. Compile, QQ gateway smoke, QQ review smoke, QQ outbox smoke, focused sent-index pytest fallback, `check_sent_index.py --help`, and `git diff --check` passed. The bare `check_sent_index.py` invocation was corrected in the validation matrix because it requires an adapter message id.
- Risk: Medium-low; no OneBot payload shape, send path, real outbound behavior, config keys, or trust persistence format changed.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-6-commit>`
- Next: If validation passes, extract QQ outbox dispatcher or add long-run diagnostics.

## Loop 7 - 19:45

- Task: Add long-run operations guidance and a read-only health diagnostic.
- Why: XinYu is a long-running local system; refactors need an operator-facing health snapshot beyond individual smoke tests.
- Files changed:
  - `XINYU-LONG-RUN-OPERATIONS.md`
  - `diagnostics/check_xinyu_health.py`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `Get-Content xinyu_status.py`
  - `Get-Content deployment_status_smoke.py`
  - `Get-Content runtime_readiness_smoke.py`
  - `.\XinYu-Core\examples\agent-apps\xinyu\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile diagnostics\check_xinyu_health.py`
  - `.\XinYu-Core\examples\agent-apps\xinyu\.venv\Scripts\python.exe diagnostics\check_xinyu_health.py --json`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe long_run_status.py`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Long-run doc and read-only diagnostic added. Compile, diagnostic execution, `long_run_status.py`, and `git diff --check` passed. The health snapshot reported current live status `critical` because existing logs contain many recent exception markers, v1 shadow trace has errors in the sampled tail, and the worktree is dirty during the loop.
- Risk: Low; diagnostic is read-only and does not start services, write runtime files, send QQ messages, or modify memory.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-7-commit>`
- Next: Continue with QQ outbox dispatcher or v1 canary gate isolation.

## Loop 8 - 20:05

- Task: Extract QQ outbox polling and dispatch loop from `xinyu_qq_gateway.py`.
- Why: Outbox claim/send/ack is a transport dispatcher responsibility and can move behind the existing `_poll_qq_outbox` compatibility method without changing OneBot payloads.
- Files changed:
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_qq_outbox_dispatcher.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_qq_gateway.py`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `Get-Content xinyu_qq_gateway.py` focused on `_poll_qq_outbox`
  - `rg -n "def _poll_qq_outbox|_poll_qq_outbox\(" xinyu_qq_gateway.py xinyu_qq_gateway_smoke.py qq_outbox_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile xinyu_qq_gateway.py xinyu_qq_outbox_dispatcher.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_qq_gateway_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe qq_outbox_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_qq_review_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_gateway_ack_spool.py::test_sent_reply_index_lookup_by_adapter_message_id -q`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Outbox dispatcher extracted. Compile, QQ gateway smoke, QQ outbox smoke, QQ review smoke, sent-index pytest fallback, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Medium; send path is structurally moved but real outbound tests are still not run. Existing smoke coverage must pass before commit.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-8-commit>`
- Next: Continue with v1 gate isolation or final report docs.

## Loop 9 - 20:25

- Task: Isolate v1 simple canary gate decisions.
- Why: v1 canary eligibility should be independently testable and reviewable without widening canary scope or changing shadow/readiness behavior.
- Files changed:
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/v1_canary_gate.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_bridge_v1_routes.py`
  - `worklog/24h-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `rg -n "_payload_has_attachment_signal|canary_payload_allowed|V1_CANARY|V1_OWNER_SIMPLE" xinyu_bridge_v1_routes.py tests\test_v1_canary_readiness.py tests\v1\test_bridge_compatibility.py tests\v1\test_hybrid_router.py`
  - `Get-Content xinyu_bridge_v1_routes.py` focused on v1 canary gate
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile xinyu_bridge_v1_routes.py v1_canary_gate.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_v1_canary_readiness.py tests\v1\test_bridge_compatibility.py tests\v1\test_hybrid_router.py -q`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe xinyu_v1_owner_simple_canary_smoke.py`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Canary gate isolated. Compile, v1 canary readiness/compatibility/hybrid pytest gate, owner simple canary smoke, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Medium-low; logic is moved but canary scope, env gates, and real traffic behavior are unchanged.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-9-commit>`
- Next: Continue with final summary docs or another bridge service boundary.

## Loop 10 - 20:45

- Task: Write the refactor summary and next 24h queue.
- Why: The long-run health diagnostic reports critical live signals, so further broad refactoring should pause until those are triaged.
- Files changed:
  - `XINYU-24H-REFACTOR-SUMMARY.md`
  - `worklog/24h-next-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `git status --short --branch`
  - `git log --oneline --reverse 5d07dcb..HEAD`
  - `git diff --name-only 5d07dcb..HEAD`
  - `diagnostics\check_xinyu_health.py --json`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Summary and next queue drafted. `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Documentation-only; no runtime, memory body, QQ outbound, persona, or v1 traffic behavior touched.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-10-commit>`
- Next: Stop and report because health diagnostics require triage before further broad refactoring.

## Loop 11 - 19:16

- Task: Extract Codex formatting and completion-outbox helpers from `xinyu_core_bridge.py`.
- Why: Codex status replies, completion summaries, image artifact discovery, and completion outbox enqueueing are Codex service responsibilities; the bridge should keep compatibility wrappers but not own the helper bodies.
- Files changed:
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_codex_service.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/xinyu_core_bridge.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/codex_delegate_smoke.py`
  - `XinYu-Core/examples/agent-apps/xinyu/codex_completion_outbox_smoke.py`
  - `worklog/24h-next-task-queue.md`
  - `worklog/24h-refactor-progress.md`
  - `XINYU-REFACTOR-CHECKLIST.md`
- Commands:
  - `git status --short --branch`
  - `rg -n "def codex_execute|def _codex_status_reply|def _codex_completion_summary|def _codex_completion_outbox_message|def _enqueue_codex_completion_if_needed|def _codex_generated_image_artifacts|def _looks_like_codex_image_generation_task|codex" xinyu_core_bridge.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile xinyu_core_bridge.py xinyu_codex_service.py codex_delegate_smoke.py codex_completion_outbox_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe codex_delegate_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe codex_completion_outbox_smoke.py`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe bridge_probe_smoke.py`
  - `git diff --check`
- Result: Codex helper logic moved into `xinyu_codex_service.py`; core bridge compatibility methods now delegate to the service. The completion-outbox smoke was corrected to assert the current no-report-file/no-report-path QQ outbox contract instead of expanding outbound behavior. Compile, Codex delegate smoke, Codex completion outbox smoke, bridge probe, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Risk: Medium-low; helper ownership moved, but route shape, Codex delegation execution, visible-window policy, and QQ outbox message contract were preserved. No real QQ outbound test was run.
- Rollback: `git revert <loop-11-commit>`
- Next: Extract Learning service boundary from `xinyu_core_bridge.py`.
